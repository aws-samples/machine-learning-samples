# Targeted Marketing with Java

This example shows how to identify potential customers for targeted
marketing campaigns, using a publicly available banking and marketing
dataset from the University of California at Irvine  (UCI) repository.
This dataset contains information about customers as well as
descriptions of their behavior in response to previous marketing
contacts. You use this data to identify which customers are most
likely to subscribe to a new product. In the sample dataset, the
product is a bank term deposit. A bank term deposit is a deposit made
into a bank with a fixed interest rate that cannot be withdrawn for a
certain period of time, also known as a certificate of deposit (CD).

This code sample demonstrates how to use the Java SDK 
to build and use the ML Model described in the Getting Started
tutorial.
